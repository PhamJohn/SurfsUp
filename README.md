## Purpose:
Using Python, SQLAlchemy, and Flask, analyze and visualize climate data.

## Results:
Weather in Hawaii is relative with less significant temperature changes when comparing data across multiple years for seasons furthest apart (Summar and Winter). During this time period, both June and December had an average temperature of 75°F and and 71°F, respectively. June had a low temperature of 64°F and a high temperature of 85°F whereas December had a low temperature of 56°F and a high temperature of 83°F. In addition, both June and December had roughly similar standard deviations. June's standard deviation of 3.26 and December's standard deviation of 3.75 tells me that their temperature records are concentrated around both of their average temperatures. Lastly, June and December had a 75th percentile of 77°F and 74°F, respectively, which indicates that these two seasons had relatively warm temperatures.

## Summary:
Precipitation was analyzed to observe quantity and frequency during June and December, and determine whether precipitation plays a factor despite the warm temperatures that are experienced during this time. Elevation also plays a part in various locations in Oahu, and determine whether one location's elevation attracts or deters business more than another location. Lastly, an analysis relative to both temperature and precipitation during June and December, and determine whether these metrics coupled together also contribute to business.
